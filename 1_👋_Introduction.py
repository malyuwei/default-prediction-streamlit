"""
Credit analysis is a critical step in borrowing money, as it involves evaluating an applicant's ability to repay the loan on time and predicting the likelihood of default. However, as the number of loan applications increases, it becomes increasingly challenging for loan officers to thoroughly review each application. To optimize costs and improve productivity, companies often look for ways to streamline the process. However, this may lead to errors and bias, as it is difficult for humans to review a large number of applications while considering all relevant factors.

Credit analysis involves assessing an applicant's creditworthiness by examining various factors, such as their credit history, income, debt-to-income ratio, and other financial information. The aim of credit analysis is to make informed decisions about lending money and to minimize the risk of loan defaults. By evaluating these factors, lenders can determine the level of risk involved in lending to the applicant and decide whether to approve or deny the loan request.
